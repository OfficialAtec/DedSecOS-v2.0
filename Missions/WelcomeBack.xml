		<body>Welcome back agent. CtOS V2 is up and running
You are in complete control of the system. It's up to you what you want to implement
Targets you'll have to meet are:
1) Get camera ops ready for immediate roll-out
2) Upgrade the Mainframe to allow higher node-counts
Attached you'll find a tutorial on how to get upgrades
I'll also send some cash your way.
