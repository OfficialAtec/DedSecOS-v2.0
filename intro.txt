Welcome back agent. CtOS has been destroyed. 
This caused your OS to go down with it.
It's up to you to get it back up and running again
We have taken intel from the original CtOS. It states that we need 1 file to get it back up again
We have forwarded that file (MainSettings.ctos) to your computer.
Go to 252.74.6.136 and upload the file to the /server/ folder.
After it's uploaded wait a few seconds for the server to come up again
